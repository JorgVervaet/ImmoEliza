README.md

So I have made 2 programs:

1 is called GetLinksImmo.py and it is used for getting all the links from 
the house that are for sale on www.immoweb.be

2 is called ImmoEliza.py and this one uses the text file created by 
GetLinksImmo.py to get all the info per page of the houses.

ImmoEliza.py is with other filenames because it is now ready to extract 
more then 10,000 houses but we didnâ€™t have the time to finish this so now 
I only have 1,000 houses.

The programs are made and tested in Python 3.10.4

Links.txt has 12,622 links of houses and apartments for sale



Thanks goes to Theano4 for the help and the support and a special thanks 
to Louis De Viron for help and the positive feedback.# ImmoEliza
